// ðŸ’¬ Static Generation is useful when your pages fetch data from a headless CMS. However, itâ€™s not ideal when youâ€™re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to preview the draft immediately on your page. Youâ€™d want Next.js to render these pages at request time instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. Youâ€™d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.

// Upon authenticating, Strapi will pass us a JWT. We store this JWT in previewData from where we will pull it anytime we want to call a Strapi API.
const previewHandler = (req, res) => {
    const previewData = {
        strapi_jwt: req.cookies[STRAPI_JWT]
    }

    res.setPreviewData(previewData)
    res.status(200).end()
    window.history.back()
}

export default previewHandler
